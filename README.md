Explaining the Application 

The purpose of the History App is to create an interactive interface for students, of my family friend (Sarah), to learn more about historical figures. At its core, the app serves as a starting point to fuel interest in the lives and names of historical figures. The app allows users to input their age and receive an output of a historical figure who died around their age. The historical figures range from musical icons to founding fathers of countries and monarchs around the world, in hopes of gaining more engagement from the users. This prompts users to research more about these figures creating a personal connection that serves as relevance to the users. The users will care more about the information they receive about the historical figure and in turn learn through a fun and interactive way. The History App is history reimagined and somewhat brought to life, through the context of relatability between the modern-day users and the historical figures.

With a simple display consisting of muted browns commonly associated with the subject of History, the application is ‘old fashioned’, setting the tone of time travel and importance for the History App. It would particularly be interesting for history buffins as they would be able to appreciate the overall colour pallet and design. The colour pallet is also warm enough, so the users experience little to no strain on their eyes when using the app. This allows for better readability and comfort, encouraging the users to spend more time on the app. 

The app layout consists of two buttons laid horizontally, with clear markings of what each button does. The editView above allows the has a ‘hint’ which disappears once users enter their chosen age (in digits), saving time and allowing for an efficient and smooth experience. Users can fully focus on the task at hand with no distractions or feeling overstimulated with the overall use of the app.

The entire application is encamped on a single page. This prevents the possibility of a longer loading time when going from one page to another to access the application features. I find it works better when running my app on a single page rather than multiple as it saves time and the frustration of having errors that transcend ‘Main Activities’ and prevent the application from working altogether. Users who may not be accustomed to using educational apps and may be put off by any irregularities will find it effortless and convenient that everything is in one place.

The fonts of the app were carefully chosen to optimize the readability and visibility. Making sure to use a dark and bold font for the app, users are able to clearly discern the written instructions and information provided, without too much strain to the eyes. The font was tested on both low lighting and high lighting to ensure that the font remains legible regardless of the user's preferred lighting. The font was secondarily selected due to its aesthetic appeal, allowing the user to enjoy their experience on the app.
The app functions on the basis of ‘if’ statements and ‘else’ throughout the code. The restrictions lay within the confines of the user input. From the age range of 20 to 100 being the options available, users are prompted to choose a rational and whole number. Should the users make use of erroneous input, like adding a number outside of the age range, a message will promptly alert them of this mistake. And redirect the user to the Home Page and allow them to re-enter a valid input, without any unnecessary obstacles or hoops to jump through. Within the same space, the History App will indicate to users if they have successfully input their numbers (in digit format). 

After numerous test runs and adjustments were made to the History App’s error handling, I can confidently say that this error and data handling allows the users to avoid overly exerting themselves trying to identify the issue when results do don’t correlate with their input. Saving the user time and frustration, and effectively creating trust between the users and the app, knowing that the app will correct their mistakes or notify them of possible solutions to the issue. The code is straightforward and laid out in an orderly fashion, it is easy to read and understand and is beginner-friendly for anyone trying to understand the workings of the background. 

And finally, the utilization of Android Studios provided a steady and trusted foundation on which to build the History App, an array of tools at any developer’s disposal of which I had taken full advantage of. With known features that are perfectly equipped to build and handle Android Apps, it seamlessly ran my many thoughts and adjustments to the code. Android Studios’ built-in emulator, although slow at times, provides a small test to run the History App, to prove that its functionality and maintains its design throughout its usage. 

The use of Android Studios made the transition between using the application only on its interface to using it and running it through into Git a much easier process due to their compatibility. 
 
Git Action and Git
Once the code for my History App was complete, I ran the app on Blue Stacks and Android Studios. No errors were detected, and none were severe enough to create an issue with the building, running, or functioning of my application.
Once that was complete, I proceeded to create a public repository on Git which included a ReadMe (where this report and YouTube video is now available). I then returned to my application in Android Studios and created a depository that would enable me to ‘push’ my app onto Git (I made use of the GitHub Instructions.pdf). I once again ran into issues with successfully pushing my application onto Git, but with some further research, I successfully did so. 

I used Git Action, to run my application to ensure that the History App was available to work on more than just my laptop and my already accessed devices. I used the building tools to run my application automatically without much interference from me. Although I did run into a few network errors and had to restart my build at least twice, my overall run was successful and tried once more to make certain of that fact. The version control was fairly easy to follow. According to the tests run, my application (History App) should be available to run on all Android versions and devices when being assessed and marked.
